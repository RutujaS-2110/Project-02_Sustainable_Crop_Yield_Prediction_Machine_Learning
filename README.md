Sustainable Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning
Agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy and food security, yet it faces numerous
challenges due to climate change, soil degradation, and unpredictable weather patterns.
Farmers often struggle with yield estimation, leading to inefficient resource allocation and
potential financial losses. Sustainable Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning aims
to address these challenges by leveraging data-driven insights for optimized agricultural
productivity.
Our project aligns with the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
specifically:
(1) Zero Hunger (SDG 2) – By improving crop yield predictions, farmers can enhance food
security and reduce the risk of shortages.
(2) Climate Action (SDG 13) – Helps in sustainable farming practices by considering
weather patterns and reducing environmental impact.
(3) Responsible Consumption & Production (SDG 12) – Optimized yield predictions
reduce wastage of agricultural resources.
(4) Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure (SDG 9) – Uses Machine Learning & AI to bring
technological advancement in agriculture.
By utilizing Machine Learning algorithms, specifically Linear Regression, we aim to predict
crop yield efficiently based on soil quality, weather conditions, and past agricultural data. Our
approach ensures sustainable farming, reduces environmental impact, and enhances decisionmaking for farmers.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
To build a predictive model for crop yield estimation using Soil Quality (pH), Weather
Conditions, and Past Agricultural Data (past_crop_yield) to help in agricultural decisionmaking.
